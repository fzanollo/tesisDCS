This thesis presents the first implementation of director synthesis, to solve problems from the field of Discrete Event Control, with the central property of non-blocking controlers.

The method takes advantage of the compositional nature of the problem and its compact input, minimizing the exponential explosion of composing the complete plant. The on-the-fly exploration with best-first-search guided by different heuristics aims to reduce the part of the plant needed to be composed. 

The implementation was incorporated to the MTSA\footnote{Modal Transition System Analyser, \href{https://bitbucket.org/lnahabedian/mtsa/src/master/^}{https://bitbucket.org/lnahabedian/mtsa/src/master/}} project, along with a test set to assert the correct results in case of future changes.
